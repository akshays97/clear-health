# Clear Health

This webapp visualizes Medicare and Medicaid claims data and informs users of the cheapest possible care in their area for treatment.

The ultimate goal of this project is to improve transparency of hospital charges and enable patients to "shop" for care online. In some use cases, this web application may empower users to negotiate their hospital bills via some mechanism similar to price-matching in e-commerce.
